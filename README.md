## Assignment

Develop a Full Stack application that facilitates image uploading from the Frontend, followed by sending the uploaded image to the backend via an API. The uploaded images will contain text content similar to the provided sample. Your task involves extracting all text content from the image on the backend, including identifying and isolating the bold words within the text.

Utilize any preferred OCR service (free or paid) for text extraction. The extracted text, bold words, and image in base64 format should be stored within a database. Implement APIs to facilitate this process.

For the frontend, display the uploaded image alongside the extracted text and bold words retrieved from the backend. Additionally, consider creating a login interface with corresponding API functionalities to enhance user access control.

Preferred technologies include Python or Java for the backend, React or Angular for the frontend, and SQL or Mongo for database management. The assignment encourages flexibility in choosing specific technologies to meet these requirements.
